## Introduction

Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-2 are powerful tools capable of generating coherent and contextually relevant text. However, they sometimes produce incorrect or fabricated information, a phenomenon known as **hallucination**. This can be problematic, especially in applications requiring factual accuracy.

This project aims to:

- Demonstrate the hallucination problem using the GPT-2 Small model.
- Implement techniques to reduce hallucinations.
- Evaluate the effectiveness of these techniques.

## Background

**Hallucination** in language models refers to the generation of plausible-sounding but incorrect or nonsensical information. This occurs because models like GPT-2 are trained to predict the next word in a sequence based on patterns learned from large text corpora, without an inherent understanding of factual correctness.

Common techniques to mitigate hallucinations include:

- **Grounded Generation:** Incorporating external knowledge bases to provide factual information.
- **Fact Verification:** Checking the generated responses against reliable sources.
- **Output Calibration:** Encouraging the model to express uncertainty when unsure.
- **Prompt Engineering:** Designing prompts to guide the model toward accurate responses.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) (Tested with version 1.13.1 or higher)
- [Transformers](https://huggingface.co/transformers/) library (Version 4.24.0 or higher)

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hallucination-mitigation.git
   cd hallucination-mitigation
Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

2. **Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)**
```   
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

```
3. ***Install Required Libraries***

```
pip install transformers torch

```
transformers: Provides access to pre-trained models and tokenizers.
torch: Required for model computations.

4. ***Usage***
Run the Script

```
python hallucination_mitigation.py
```

The script will output responses for each technique:

Baseline Model Responses: Demonstrates the hallucination problem.
Grounded Generation Responses: Uses the knowledge base to provide accurate answers.
Fact Verification Responses: Generates responses and verifies them against the knowledge base.
Output Calibration Responses: Encourages the model to express uncertainty.
Prompt Engineering Responses: Guides the model toward accurate responses through carefully crafted prompts.
Sample Output


- Baseline Responses

Prompt: Who is the author of the book 'The Lost City of Z'?
Response: ...

- Metrics for Baseline:
Accuracy: 33.33%
Hallucination Rate: 66.67%
Uncertainty Rate: 0.00%

... (Other techniques)
Results
After running the script, you will obtain responses and metrics for each technique. Here's an example of expected metrics:

| Technique            | Accuracy (%) | Hallucination Rate (%) | Uncertainty Rate (%) |
|----------------------|--------------|------------------------|----------------------|
| Baseline             | 33.33        | 66.67                  | 0.00                 |
| Grounded Generation  | 66.67        | 0.00                   | 33.33                |
| Fact Verification    | 66.67        | 0.00                   | 33.33                |
| Output Calibration   | 66.67        | 0.00                   | 33.33                |
| Prompt Engineering   | 66.67        | 0.00                   | 33.33                |

***Interpretation:****

Baseline: High hallucination rate due to the model's lack of factual grounding.
Other Techniques: Improved accuracy and reduced hallucination rate by guiding the model through prompts and verification.
Conclusion
The GPT-2 Small model, while powerful, is prone to hallucinations when generating responses without guidance. By implementing techniques such as Grounded Generation, Fact Verification, Output Calibration, and Prompt Engineering, we can significantly reduce hallucinations and improve the model's reliability.

***Key Takeaways:***

Grounded Generation: Directly uses a knowledge base to provide accurate information.
Fact Verification: Validates the model's output against external data sources.
Output Calibration: Encourages the model to express uncertainty appropriately.
Prompt Engineering: Influences the model's responses through carefully designed prompts and examples.

***Future Work***

Expand the Knowledge Base: Include more entries to cover a wider range of topics.
Fine-Tune the Model: Train GPT-2 on a dataset with question-answer pairs to improve its factual accuracy.
Experiment with Larger Models: Use GPT-2 Medium or Large for potentially better performance.
Integrate Retrieval-Augmented Generation: Combine retrieval mechanisms with generation for more accurate responses.
